## ðŸ”§ Prerequisites
Before using this tool, make sure you have:
1. **An empty repository on GitHub**  
   - You **must create a new repository manually** on GitHub before running this script.
   - Do **not** initialize it with a README or other files.
   
2. **A GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**  
   - Since GitHub removed password authentication for Git operations, you'll need a **PAT (Personal Access Token)**.
   - To generate a PAT:
     1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
     2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**.
     3. Select scopes:  
        - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     4. Click **Generate Token** and **copy it** (You wonâ€™t see it again!).

3. **Git installed on your system**  
   - If Git is not installed, install it:  
     **Mac:** `brew install git`  
     **Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install git`  
     **Windows:** [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
